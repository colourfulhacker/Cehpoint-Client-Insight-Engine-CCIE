1. HERO SECTION (Complete Rebuild Required)
Problems in your current hero:

No visual hierarchy

Weak CTA

No premium layout

Metrics look like plain rectangles

Typography is inconsistent

Replace with:
A. Visual Layout

Full-width light background with subtle gradient

Centered hero content

Clean spacing: 140px top / 120px bottom

Enterprise-style abstract mesh or geometric background elements

B. Typography

H1: 56px, Inter Bold, tight tracking

H2/subtext: 20px, Inter Regular, 55% width max

C. CTA

Two buttons:

Primary: solid dark navy (#0C0F1A)

Secondary: ghost or outline

D. Metrics (3 KPIs)

Use cards styled like Stripe or Notion metrics:

White cards

Soft shadow (0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.05))

Rounded corners (16px)

Icon + number + label

2. ANALYSIS FEATURES SECTION (Redesign Required)
Problems:

Icons outdated

Cards too boxy

Text visually dense

No spacing or harmony

New design:

Use a 3-column grid

Each feature card:

Icon: 48px, minimal line style

Title: 20–22px Semibold

Body: max 3 lines

Card style: frosted glass or minimal shadow

Example layout:

Icon	Smart Classification
Small description underneath	

This solves the clutter.

3. WORKFLOW SECTION (“How it Works”)

This must be redesigned into a modern 3-step horizontal timeline.

Current problems:

Big numbered circles look outdated

Text alignment is inconsistent

A vertical divider looks broken

New design pattern:

A horizontal timeline with:

Step 1 — thin line — Step 2 — thin line — Step 3

Each step card:

Circle with number (soft navy)

Title in bold

Short description (max 2 lines)

Spacing: 64px between steps.

4. DARK CTA BAND (BOTTOM SECTION)

Right now it looks stretched, unaligned, and visually dull.

Replace with:

Navy background (#0B0F2A)

Centered text

Max width container (1100px)

CTA button centered

Padding: 80px top, 80px bottom

5. FOOTER SECTION

Your current footer is extremely basic and kills the premium feel.

Replace with a structured 3-column footer:

Column 1: Company

Column 2: Product

Column 3: Legal

Thin divider above

Slightly smaller text with 70% opacity

Add:

Social icons

Trademark/logos

Address or “Global offices” tagline

6. SPACING SYSTEM (Most Important)

Tell the developer to follow a spacing scale:

0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 120

Most amateur-looking pages fail because spacing is inconsistent.
Your redesign MUST apply this scale strictly.

7. COLOR SYSTEM

Use this exact palette for enterprise-grade aesthetics:

Primary: #0C1A3D
Secondary: #2D65FF
Accent: #7BA7FF
Background: #F5F7FA
Cards: #FFFFFF
Borders: rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
Text Primary: #0A0A0A
Text Secondary: #4B4B4B

8. TYPOGRAPHY STANDARDS

Use:

H1: Inter 56px / bold

H2: Inter 36px / semibold

H3: Inter 24px / semibold

Body: 17px / regular

Microtext: 14px / regular

Line heights:

Headlines 1.1

Body 1.6

9. SHADOW/ELEVATION SYSTEM

Use only these 2 elevations:

Shadow 1 (cards):
0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)

Shadow 2 (hover):
0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)

Do NOT use dark or heavy drop shadows.

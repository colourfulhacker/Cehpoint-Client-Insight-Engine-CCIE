1. Visual Identity & Layout Architecture
A. Replace the Dark Theme With a Modern Enterprise Palette

Current palette looks flat and generic. Move to a professional, high-contrast palette.

Recommended:

Primary: Deep Sapphire (#0C1A3D)

Secondary: Royal Blue (#2D65FF)

Accents: Bright Azure (#4D9BFF), Ultramarine (#2957FF)

Background: Off-White (#F7F8FA)

Text: Charcoal Black (#141414)

B. Introduce a Grid-based Layout (12-column)

Your current layout is cluttered and lacks spacing hierarchy.

Adopt:

12-column grid

80–100px section spacing

24–32px internal padding

Use clear vertical rhythm and grouping

C. Reduce the Number of Boxes

Right now everything is packed into boxes, which makes it look crowded.
Move to:

Section dividers

Icon + heading strip

2–3 cards only where necessary

2. Typography System

Replace all the current fonts with a premium, enterprise-grade type system.

Recommended stack:

Headings: Inter Semibold

Body: Inter Regular

Metrics/Values: Inter Bold

Hierarchy:

H1: 48–56px

H2: 32–36px

H3: 24–28px

Body: 16–18px

3. Hero Section Redesign

Current hero area is text-heavy and visually dull.

A. Fix the hero to a clean, high-impact enterprise hero:

Large bold headline

Subheading with 2 lines max

Only one CTA button

Decorative abstract background (gradient wave, bokeh, mesh, or geometric shapes)

B. Replace the 3 KPI boxes (15, 5, 3)

Use a horizontal card strip with:

Glassmorphism or soft shadow

Icon + metric + label

Make it visually premium.

4. Component Redesign
A. Smart Classification / Targeted Recommendations / Personalized Outreach

Replace those cards with:

Minimalist soft-shadow cards

Professional iconography (Lucide / Feather / Material Symbols Outlined)

Shorter text (3 lines max)

Hover elevation

B. Workflow Section (Upload, Process, Export)

Create a 3-step timeline with iconography, not “big circles with numbers”.

C. Advanced Capabilities Section

Right now it's cluttered and poorly spaced.

Use:

A 2-column grid

Minimalist pill tags or small cards

Uniform iconography

5. Micro-Interaction & Motion Design

Introduce motion primitives:

Fade-in hero & metric counters

Hover elevation on cards

Slide-in workflow steps

Use Framer Motion or GSAP.

6. Spacing, Whitespace, and Hierarchy

Right now the page looks cramped.

Fix:

Increase whitespace by 40–60%

Increase top/bottom padding for each block

Ensure at least 24px spacing between elements

Maintain consistent margins

7. Replace the Button Styles

Current buttons are old-styled.

Use:

Pill or rounded-medium corners

12–16px vertical padding

Slight gradient or subtle glow on hover

Icons inside buttons

8. Replace the Footer

Your footer looks outdated. Build a minimal enterprise footer:

Flat background

3-columns: Company | Product | Legal

Simple, thin separators

9. Content Refinement

Simplify the language:

Replace long paragraphs with concise enterprise copy

Use strong verbs and value-driven messaging

Add micro-descriptions under each capability

Rebuild the entire landing page using a proper enterprise-grade design system.
Do not tweak the existing layout. Replace it completely according to the following specifications.

1. HERO SECTION (MUST BE REBUILT)

Use a split hero layout (Left: text & CTA, Right: visual).

Add a premium background mesh/gradient or abstract geometric graphic on the right side.

Hero must use:

H1: 56px, bold

Subtext: 20px, max width 600px

CTA buttons (Primary + Secondary)

Remove empty whitespace and create a clearly structured hero block.

2. KPI METRIC STRIP (15 / 5 / 3)

Replace the current rectangle boxes completely.

Use this exact structure:

3 horizontal cards, equal width, same height

White cards with 20–24px rounded corners

Soft shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)

Icon inside a circular colored badge

Number: 32px bold

Label: 14px medium

Ensure alignment is pixel-perfect.

3. FEATURE CARDS (Smart Classification, Recommendations, Outreach)

Rebuild this section using a three-column modern grid.

Card specification:

White background

Border: 1px solid #E5E7EB

Padding: 32px

Icon at top with circular halo

Title: 20–22px semibold

Description: max 2 lines

Shadow on hover: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

Equal spacing between cards

These cards must look like Stripe/Linear-style components.

4. HOW IT WORKS (CONVERT TO TIMELINE)

Replace the current bulky circles and vertical divider.

Use a horizontal 3-step timeline:

[Step 1] —— [Step 2] —— [Step 3]


Each step must contain:

Number inside a circular badge

Title (18–20px)

Short description (2 lines max)

Equal card heights

Subtle hover elevation

Spacing: 64px between steps.

5. DARK CTA SECTION (REBUILD)

The current dark bar looks like a footer. Rebuild it as a premium CTA.

Requirements:

Navy gradient background

Large headline: 32–36px bold

Subheading: 18px

CTA button centered

Container max width: 1100px

Add subtle mesh/noise texture for visual depth

6. FOOTER (RESTRUCTURE)

Use a 3-column professional enterprise footer:

Column 1: Company

Column 2: Product

Column 3: Legal

Add:

Thin divider line above

14px text

Consistent spacing

Better vertical padding

7. GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Use the following:

Typography:

Inter

H1: 56px

H2: 36px

H3: 24px

Body: 17px

Line heights:

Headlines: 1.1

Body: 1.6

Spacing Scale:

Use only:
0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 120
Spacing must be consistent across all sections.

Color Palette:

Primary: #0C1A3D

Secondary: #2D65FF

Accent: #7BA7FF

Background: #F5F7FA

Card Background: #FFFFFF

Border: rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

Text Primary: #0A0A0A

Text Secondary: #4B4B4B

Shadows:

Card default: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)

Hover: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)

8. DON’T DO THE FOLLOWING:

Do NOT reuse the old boxes or layout.

Do NOT place items randomly without a grid.

Do NOT keep the outdated icons.

Do NOT use uneven spacing or arbitrary paddings.

Do NOT apply overly dark or heavy shadows.

9. GOAL

Deliver a clean, modern, enterprise SaaS landing page similar in standard to:

Stripe

Linear

HubSpot

Notion

Segment

Everything must look premium, aligned, balanced, and intentionally structured.
